## Ophiuchus Protostellar Disk Survey Imaging Scripts
This is the default set of imaging scripts for the Ophiuchus protostellar disk survey project, 2023.1.00545.S.
As a post-processing step of auto-selfcal (https://github.com/jjtobin/auto_selfcal), it split continuum MS (with line channels flagged), and performing continuum and line imagings. By adjusting the script settings, it can be applied to any project.

After the series of processes in auto-selfcal is completed, in the Work directory, in addition to the auto-selfcal scripts and log files, the following should be present:
- *_targets.ms (self-calibrated data stored in the CORRECTED column)
- *_targets.contsub.ms (the continuum-subtracted MS data)
- cont.dat　

## Imaging Procedure
1. Download this imaging scripts: git clone https://github.com/saigokz/Ophiuchus_protostellar_disks    or Copy scripts into the Work directory
2. Move into the Work directory and copy all *.py files to the work directory  from the Ophiuchus_protostellar_disks directory.
3. Create continuum MS: execfile('make_contMS.py')  in CASA (version 6.5.2 or later)
- This generates *_targets.ms.ave.cont, in which spectral line channel ranges are flagged and the channels are averaged to a width of 10 kHz.
- This script reads the cont.dat file.
5. Continuum imaging: [Example] execfile('Oph_continuum_LB.v5.py')  in CASA (version 6.5.2 or later)
- When running SB (Short Baseline data, i.e., TM2) or LB (Long Baseline data, i.e., TM1) in the Work directory, simply execute the corresponding script (e.g., Oph_continuum_SB.v5.py for SB, Oph_continuum_LB.v5.py for LB). For SBLB, edit the Setting section in the script to specify the path to the data directory.
- In default: with robust = -2.0, -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0,  without uctaper
6. Line imaging [Example] execfile('Oph_spectral_lines_LB.v5.py')  in CASA (version 6.5.2 or later)
- When running SB (Short Baseline data, i.e., TM2) or LB (Long Baseline data, i.e., TM1) in the Work directory, simply execute the corresponding script (e.g., Oph_spectral_lines_SB.v5.py for SB, Oph_spectral_lines_LB.v5.py for LB). For SBLB, edit the Setting section in the script to specify the path to the data directory.
- In default: C18O(2-1), 13CO(2-1), 12CO(2-1), etc. with robust = -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 2.0 (without uvtaper)
